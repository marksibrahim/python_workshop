4 steps function example is a bit hard to follow 


maybe break up lower into one step (show it)
then show replace()

then show chain

transform and measure (maybe just one? or introduce one at a time)


Review is fantastic!

Module question is a bit tricky to follow 

NICE: motivating functions (block becomes one line is great)

* ipython program.py or python program.py?
    * where do we introduce interactive mode?

* half way through timer
